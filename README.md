# Banana Slug Webpage

The Banana Dlug webpage while simple, was the first page created in the course. This page will serve as a starting point for me to be able ot observe future growth on projects.

#### Process of the slug

This was a very simple and rough page. My hope is that in the future as I upload more and more to gitHub that this will serve as a start line. It isn't anything fancy, in fact it's pretty ugly! But everyone needs a start.

#### Where to go from here?

This is the first and last I will update the slug. It isn't meant to be some grand piece of coding. It won't be updated. It is simply the first book on the shelf.
I will update my main portfolio page and upload more porjects as time progresses.
